    <h1>How to enter grants for the Detroit Ledger</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal is to capture philanthropic giving that has an impact on Detroit.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Here’s what counts as Detroit impact:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>by <b>address</b>: the organization that is receiving funds is located in Detroit</li>
      <li>by <b>mission</b>: the organization has a mission focused on impacting Detroit, even though it is located elsewhere (such as Some Organization located in Livonia, MI)</li>
      <li>by <b>grant description</b>: the organization is involved in a project that will impact Detroit (though the organization may be based elsewhere)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>The Detroit Ledger is made up mainly of two types of data records: <b>grants</b> and <b>organizations</b>. You're going to help us add grant records based on what you find in a funding organization's IRS Form 990. Each year, tax exempt nonprofits have to file a Form 990 with the government. This form includes all sorts of information about the organization, but the part we're most interested in is called "Schedule I". This section contains a list of the organization's big donations it makes to other organizations.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick a 990; your 990 will show up on the left and the form will be on the right. The funder and fiscal year auto-populate</li>
      <li>Scroll through your 990 and find "Schedule I: Grants and Other Assistance..."</li>
      <li>Enter grants using the "Detroit impact" criteria above. Each grant needs a:
        <ul>
          <li>Start and end date</li>
          <li>Funder</li>
          <li>Recipient</li>
          <li>Source, eg "IRS 990 2016"</li>
          <li>Amount</li>
          <li>Description</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the recipient organization doesn't already exist, add it!</li>
      <li>Mark your 990 as "done". If you quit before you're done, we'll save your current page until next time</li>
    </ol>
